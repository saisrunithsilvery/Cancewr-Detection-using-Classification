Breast Cancer Classification with Python
This project focuses on classifying breast cancer tumors using Python. The classification is based on data obtained from fine needle aspiration biopsies.
Types of Tumors
The project distinguishes between two types of tumors:
Benign Tumor
Non-cancerous
Capsulated
Slow-growing
Malignant Tumor
Cancerous
Non-capsulated
Fast-growing
Dataset
The dataset used in this project is derived from fine needle aspiration (FNA) biopsies. FNA is a diagnostic procedure where a thin needle is inserted into an area of abnormal-appearing tissue or body fluid to collect a sample1
. This sample is then analyzed to:
Help make a diagnosis
Rule out conditions such as cancer
